		<!--Introduce Inazuma-->
		<h2>Inazuma: The Territory of Eternity</h2>
		<p>
		The third territory the traveller goes to is Inazuma. Inazuma is the territory of eternity, ruled by the Electro Archon, Baal, 
		who is now referred to as Ei and whose identity as an Archon is known to the public. This region represents the element of 
		electricity. When developing the game, Hoyoverse designed Inazuma based on Japan’s culture and style. Inazuma is also known
		for its excellent bladesmithing techniques.
		</p>

		<h2>Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves</h2>
		<p>
		Inazuma is an isolated nation protected by a thunderstorm barrier that prevents anyone from entering or exiting. The traveller 
		meets Beidou, the captain of the Crux Ship, as recommended by Ningguang. She is the only one who can navigate through the stormy 
		weather and dark waters of Inazuma alive. Aboard the Crux Ship, Beidou introduces the traveller to a wandering samurai by the 
		name of Kazuha. Kazuha possesses a masterless electro vision, one from a fallen friend who challenged the gods. Kazuha wishes
		to travel to Inazuma in hopes of reawakening the vision's electro abilities. A vision is a gift bestowed by the gods on those
		who present exceptional passion or ambition. The element of the vision depends on the god’s respective element when given to 
		a user. The user of a vision then has the power to manipulate the element of their vision. In Inazuma, a force led by the 
		archon herself called the Vision Hunt Decree had been put in place to deprive vision holders of their visions, losing their
		ambition and passion in the process.
		</p>
		
		<!--Main Content Vision Hunt Decree-->
		<h2>The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia</h2>
		<p>
		Beidou, Kazuha, and the traveller set sail for Inazuma. After a treacherous journey, they make it to Inazuma’s port, Ritou, 
		where they are greeted by Thoma, Beidou’s business partner, and attendant of the Kamisato Clan. Beidou and Kazuha leave the 
		scene, as Kazuha is a wanted fugitive in Inazuma. Thoma helps the traveller process themselves through Ritou’s rigorous security.
		The traveller explains to Thoma how they wish to see the Electro Archon, Ei, also known as the Raiden Shogun, to the public. 
		While offering his help, Thoma asks the traveller for a favour in return. Hearing of the traveller’s feats in other nations, 
		Kamisato Ayaka, the Kamisato Clan’s eldest daughter, had Thoma ask the traveller for their help with disabling the cruel 
		Vision Hunt Decree. On the way to the Kamisato residence, the traveller sees the Statue of the Omnipresent God, where its 
		embedded gems are the confiscated visions captured by the Vision Hunt Decree. The traveller bears witness to the suffering 
		of former vision bearers who’d lost families, friends, and their memories. Seeing the damage the Vision Hunt Decree has caused
		first-hand, the traveller agrees to help Kamisato Ayaka abolish it when they arrive at the Kamisato estate.
		</p>
		<p>
		Kamisato Ayaka explains how a friend of hers helped create fake visions to protect the people and had been arrested for such deeds. 
		Asking for help, the traveller agrees to go to the specified location to break Ayaka’s friend out of prison. At the location, 
		the traveller meets Yoiymiya, the daughter of the owner of Naganohara Fireworks. Being acquainted with Ayaka, Yoiymiya joins 
		the traveller in breaking Ayaka’s friend out of prison. Yoiymiya and the traveller make it to the prison, where the friend is 
		being tortured by the guards. Kujou Sara, sympathetic to the traveller and Yoiymiya’s courage, allows them to escape with the
		prisoner.
		</p>
		
		<!--Main Content Save Thoma-->
		<h2>Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow</h2>
		<p>
		Returning with Ayaka’s friend, the traveller, Thoma, and Ayaka decide to eat a celebratory hot pot, only to find out Thoma went 
		missing minutes later. The traveller and Ayaka both reach the same conclusion: that Thoma had been captured by the Vision Hunt 
		Decree, making him their one-hundredth victim. Fearing the worst, the traveller asks Ayaka to stay behind to calm the people 
		while they and Paimon go to save Thoma. Making it just in time, the traveller intercepts the Raiden Shogun, taking Thoma’s vision 
		to inlay it into the statue. Impressed by the traveller’s bravery without a vision, the Raiden Shogun summons the traveller 
		into an alternate realm for a battle. Thoma interferes with the alternate battle and flees with the traveller, resulting in 
		them being on the wanted list. Thoma goes into hiding for some time, advising the traveller to seek help from the resistance
		of the Watatsumi Army.

		<p>
		Making it to Watatsumi Island, the traveller meets a resistance soldier by the name of Teppei. He explains that the general of 
		the resistance, Gorou, is looking for people like the traveller to join the resistance. Teppei mentions that the Raiden Shogun 
		is using the Vision Hunt Decree to get closer to her goal of reaching eternity. Because of this, Kujou Sara leads an exceptionally
		powerful army in the Raiden Shogun’s favour. Upon meeting General Gorou, he immediately welcomes the traveller into the ranks 
		of the resistance. While introducing the traveller to the different training facilities, they get word of the Shogunate Army 
		breaching the camp. This breach ends up damaging the walls of the camp, so everyone in the resistance begins to repair and reinforce 
		the walls, only to find out the Shogunate Army, led by Kujou Sara, is advancing to the main front. Gorou leads the resistance to 
		the main front to engage in battle. Amid the battle, water bubbles seem to form from thin air, preceded by the entry of Sangonomiya 
		Kokomi, master of the strategic arts and leader of the resistance. With Kokomi’s entrance came the resistance’s reinforcements, 
		as well as Beidou and Kazuha. Now outnumbered, the Shogunate Army is forced to retreat.

		<h2>Omnipresence Over Mortals</h2>
		<p>
		Following the battle, Kokomi arranges a meeting with the traveller to go over introductions and explains to the traveller about a 
		mysterious sender who sent the resistance supplies that they urgently needed. To Teppei’s bewilderment, Kokomi also promotes the 
		traveller up to captain of the Swordfish II spec ops group. Eventually, Kokomi decides to promote Teppei to captain as well. Teppei 
		and the group he commands, using the supplies the mysterious sender sent them, go on a few expeditions to scout the area further. 
		Teppai returns from delivering supplies to the front line in a slightly worse coughing state, which Teppei brushes off as a cold 
		he caught at sea.
		</p>
		<p>
		The traveller reports back to Gorou and Kokomi, where they interrupt a discussion between the two about the strange symptoms the 
		resistance has been exhibiting since the use of the supplies the mysterious sender has been sending. Recognizing the supplies 
		Gorou takes out, the traveller frantically reveals to them that the supplies they’ve been using were delusions crafted by the 
		Fatui, which enhance a person’s physical performance in exchange for their lifespan. Remembering Teppei’s coughing state earlier, 
		the traveller and Paimon rush to find Teppei. Spotting Teppei, it is clear that Teppei has aged significantly and is taking weaker
		breaths. The traveller explains to Teppei that the supplies he and the resistance were using were Fatui delusions, which were slowly
		taking their lives. Accepting this fate, Teppei makes his final remarks, hoping to see them once more in the afterlife, and passes
		seconds later.
		</p>
		<p>
		With many soldiers dead and terminally ill, Kokomi wishes to confiscate all delusions being used throughout the resistance by 
		eliminating the problem at the source. She deduces that the production of the delusions is located on the island in closest 
		proximity to their island, Watatsumi since Inazuma doesn’t allow transportation of goods outside the region. The traveller 
		makes their way to the island. Making it to the factory producing the delusions, the traveller confronts the Fatui Harbinger
		running the factory, Scaramouche. Claiming the importance of delusions, Scaramouche angers the traveller by bringing up the
		fallen Teppei in the conversation. Yae Miko, the fox servant of Ei, the Electro Archon, emerges on the scene to confront 
		Scaramouche before the traveller collapses from rage.
		</p>
		<p>
		Following the events, the traveller wakes up to Yae Miko explaining how the traveller is the only one who can save Inazuma
		and the Electro Archon, Ei, who was hiding in the sword used by the Raiden Shogun puppet, from the Vision Hunt Decree and 
		the Raiden Shogun puppet. Seeing how the traveller was brought to the alternate realm by Ei before, Yae Miko believes that 
		the traveller can be transported there once more to defeat and convince Ei to abolish the Vision Hunt Decree. Yae Miko immediately 
		initiates specialized training for the traveller, as Ei is a powerful opponent. Leaving the traveller to be trained, Yae Miko 
		travels back to her shrine, where she meets with Kujou Sara, the leader of the Shogunate Army, in order to convince her that
		the Vision Hunt Decree is a lie being controlled by the Fatui. Unfazed by this, Kujou Sara demands evidence from Yae Miko within 
		the next three days, which Yae Miko agrees to provide.
		</p>
		<p>
		<img src = "images/pinkTrinket.jpg" id = "pinkTrinket" alt = "Pink Trinket">
		Yae Miko sends the traveller to retrieve evidence from the professional ninja of the forest named Sayu. On par with their travels
		to the forest, the traveller meets up with Ayaka and Thoma once more to explain the situation. Feeling unsure, Ayaka has the 
		traveller meet with Yoiymiya once again to ask for her aid. Yoiymiya, having access to her father’s company’s fireworks, agrees 
		to set a distraction in order for the Sayu to retrieve war documents as requested by Ayaka. Scanning the retrieved documents on 
		future Fatui collaborations, Ayaka asks the traveller to return to Yae Miko’s shrine with the documents. At the shrine, Yae Miko
		presents Kujou Sara with the war documents, which leaves her enraged, and she storms off to her home. Yae Miko presents the 
		traveller with a <i>pink trinket</i>, asking them to hold on to it for her before setting off to follow Sara to further convince
		her, as she holds the most legal power. 
		</p>
		<p>
		At Kujou Sara’s abode, her adoptive father explains to her how Signora, a Fatui harbinger, was the mastermind behind the state of 
		distress Inazuma was in and was in another part of the city. Heading there, the traveller finds the Raiden Shogun puppet and Signora 
		in a heated argument with Kujou Sara unconscious on the floor. This argument between the two leads to a battle of arrogance, where 
		the execution of Signora ensues at the Raiden Shogun puppet’s hand. Allowing the traveller to walk out alive, the Raiden Shogun 
		puppet leaves the building. The traveller follows her but instead is greeted by the resistance along with Gorou and Kazuha. Before 
		the traveller could take another step, the Raiden Shogun puppet appeared behind them, about to strike them down. Noticing first, 
		Kazuha darts toward the Raiden Shogun puppet with intense focus to protect everyone. With such passion, the masterless vision 
		Kazuha possessed reignites to aid Kazuha in blocking the attack. The traveller then takes a strike at the Raiden Shogun puppet
		but is instead transported to the alternate realm, Ei’s plane of Euthymia, where they’ve previously been.

		<p>
		Speaking to the Electro Archon, Ei, the traveller protests her discontinuation of the Vision Hunt Decree. Ei refutes that the 
		Vision Hunt Decree does not interfere with her ideals of eternity. The traveller then challenges Ei to a duel, which she willingly 
		accepts in order to change her mind on the matter. During the battle, the traveller takes out the pink trinket Yae Miko had them 
		hold on to, which summons Yae Miko to the plane of their battle. Yae Miko then requests the traveller tap into the visions embedded 
		in the statue, which repel the decree and defeat Ei in the plane. Accepting defeat, Ei listens to what the traveller and Yae Miko 
		have to say. Realizing the decree is doing more harm than good, Ei abolishes the Vision Hunt Decree. After realizing her mistake, 
		Ei returns all the seized visions embedded in the statue back to their owners, restoring the memories of the vision holders and 
		peace in the land.
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally returning to Yae Miko’s shrine, Paimon celebrates their victory and how Ei still has her gnosis. To this, Yae Miko replies 
		that she traded it to Scaramouche in return for the traveller’s safety. Ei reveals how she saw the gnosis as an object of conflict 
		with her ideals of eternity and was glad to give it away in order to cut her ties with Celestia. Thanking the traveller for helping
		her see the truth, Ei promises to help find their lost sibling and advises them to travel to the region of Sumeru next.

		<!--Inazuma Backstory Twin Gods-->
		<h2>The Islands of Inazuma: Home to Eternity</h2>
		<p>
		Around two thousand years ago, two twin gods, Baal and Beelzebulb, slew the other gods in the Inazuma region. While Raiden Ei 
		(Beelzebulb) is believed to be a stronger fighter, Raiden Makoto (Baal) was better fit to lead the country. After ascending to
		Celestia with Beelzebulb’s sacrifice, Makoto decides to reforge a new body for Ei to reside in. Together, they both ruled 
		Inazuma and tricked the people into believing that there was only one leader.
		</p>
		
		<!--Inazuma Backstory The Kitesune-->
		<h3>The Kitesune Named Yae Miko</h3>
		<p>
		Years before the Archon War, the Tanuki inhabited the land of Inazuma. The Kitsune migrate there one day, and a fight for 
		ownership of the land ensues. After 1600 years of fighting, neither group has admitted defeat. However, the Kitsune gained
		ownership over the Sacred Sakura Tree. Over time, the Kitsune and Tanuki forget about the war, thus resulting in the emergence
		of humans.
		</p>
		<p>
		After the Archon War, the Kitsune decided to establish the Great Narukami Shrine at the Sacred Sakura Tree. They defeat the 
		Tengu warriors, who become their bodyguards afterwards. During the cataclysm, Makoto goes to Khaenri'ah while leaving Ei to 
		defend Inazuma. When Ei arrives in Khaenri'ah, she finds Makoto dying. She saves her sister’s consciousness in the Plane of
		Euthymia. Years after her sister’s death, Ei decides to seal herself in the plane in order to stave off erosion. She constructs 
		a puppet but decides that giving him a Gnosis would be disadvantageous and instead sets him free after sealing away his power. 
		Instead, Ei gives her gnosis to Yae Miko.
		</p>
		
		<!--Inazuma Backstory Underground World-->
		<h3>Enkanomiya</h3>
		<p>
		The people of Enkanomiya, having been forsaken by the gods, constructed an artificial sun in order to ward off the creatures 
		living in the dark. Orobashi, the serpent god, saved the people from the Dragon of the Depths. The serpent god would go on to 
		create Watatsumi Island, lead the Sangonomiya Clan, and also learn about the truth of the world. It was eliminated afterwards 
		by the Raiden Shogun.
		</p>
		
		<!--Inazuma Backstory Tsurumi Island-->
		<h3>Ruu’s Song</h3>
		<p>
		Civilization on Tsurumi Island is wiped out due to unknown reasons and rebuilt afterwards. The Thunderbird also makes its home 
		on the island. A few thousand years later, a boy named Ruu is born on the island. Over the years, the people of Tsurumi Island 
		adopted a tradition where they sacrifice a child to the Thunderbird. While practising singing, Ruu one day encounters the 
		Thunderbird and befriends her. He names her &quot;Kanna Kapatcir,&quot; and they make a promise to meet again in the future so that 
		she can hear him sing his song. The situation on Tsurumi gets worse as people leave the island in search of better lives. 
		People on the island believe that they have died. Ruu becomes a voluntary sacrifice as the inhabitants believe that the deaths
		were caused by the Thunderbird’s rage. Instead, Ruu’s sacrifice enraged Kanna Kapatcir, so she destroyed the island. Wanting 
		to hear his singing again, she causes the day of destruction to repeat over and over again by creating a Ley Line Disorder. 
		The thunderbird is eventually slain by Raiden Ei, who sees her as a threat.
