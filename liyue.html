		<!--Introduce Liyue-->
		<h2>Liyue: The Region of Contracts</h2>
		<p>
		The second region the traveller goes to is Liyue. Liyue is the region of contracts, ruled by the Geo Archon, Morax, who is now 
		referred to as Zhongli, the Wangsheng Funeral Parlour's mysterious consultant. This region represents the ability of the rock. 
		Hoyoverse, the developer of the game, designed Liyue based on China’s culture and architecture. Liyue is also known as Teyvat’s 
		only producer of Mora, Teyvat’s universal currency. 
		</p>

		<!--Main Content Death of a Dragon-->
		<h2>The Land Amidst Monoliths</h2>
		<p>
		Arriving at Liyue Harbour, the traveller, and Paimon make it just in time to witness Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing,
		summon Rex Lapis, the name of Morax’s dragon form, and appear dead before the citizens of Liyue. Ningguang orders the Millelith,
		Liyue’s military force, to capture all possible suspects responsible for the death of Rex Lapis. Trying to escape the chaos, the
		traveller flees from the scene, only to be hunted down by the Millelith. A young hydro user (wielder of the water element) who 
		goes by the name of &quot;Childe&quot; comes to the traveller’s aid to ask the traveller if they’d seen Signora in Mondstadt. Coming to 
		the realization that Childe is one of the harbingers, the traveller becomes wary of him but agrees to meet him at the Northland
		Bank when asked. At Northland Bank, Childe explains that they must receive the approval of the adepti, illuminated beasts, and
		gods in contract to protect Liyue at all costs, in order to clear their name of any suspicion. Childe hands the traveller a sigil,
		which is required to safely enter the abode of the adepti.
		</p>
		<p>
		Upon meeting the Moon Carver, an adepti, the traveller explains how Rex Lapis has been assassinated and that they need to clear 
		their name of any suspicion of being responsible for the assassination. Moon Carver tells the traveller to seek the help of Cloud 
		Retainer, Mountain Shaper, and the Demon Conqueror, an adeptus who takes on a human form and goes by &quot;Xiao.&quot; The traveller gifts 
		Xiao his favourite dish, almond tofu, explains to Mountain Shaper about Rex Lapis’s death, and makes food offerings to Cloud 
		Retainer to win the hearts of the three adepti. Childe later informs the traveller that the Liyue Qixing is refusing to let any
		civilians see Rex Lapis’s body. To this, Paimon accidentally reveals that they originally came to visit the Geo Archon, whose
		dragon form was supposedly killed. Childe suspiciously takes note of this information and promises to help the traveller in some way.
		</p>
		
		<!--Main Content Funeral Shopping List-->
		<h2>Farewell, Archaic Lord</h2>
		<p>
		Childe reports back to the traveller, asking to meet him at a restaurant, where they meet Zhongli, a consultant of the Wangsheng 
		Funeral Parlour who is secretly Rex Lapis’s human form. Zhongli mentions that the adepti are slowly distancing themselves from 
		the rise of mankind. He leaves with mora, Teyvat’s currency, given by Childe, to buy some jade to prepare a proper farewell to 
		Rex Lapis’s mourning. The traveller follows Zhongli to help him buy items for the funeral.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Noctilucous Jade sold by Shitou</li>
			<li>Perfumes created by silk flowers sold by Ying’er</li>
			<li>Cleansing Bell given by Madame Ping (who is an adepti)</li>
			<li>Kites sold by Granny Shan</li>
			<li>Services supplied by three brothers named Tic, Tac and Toe</li>
			<li>Everlasting Incense sold at Bubu Pharmacy</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Childe asks the traveller for more information about the reasoning behind their trip to Liyue, but to Childe’s dismay, the 
		traveller refuses. With no more mora to spend, Zhongli and the traveller are left with one more item on the list: the everlasting 
		incense sold at Bubu Pharmacy. They negotiate with Qiqi, a child clerk for the pharmacy. She requests a cocogoat in return 
		for free everlasting incense. Zhongli and the traveller go to a disabled Guizhong Ballista, which serves as a tracking device 
		for things in the area. After collecting spare parts to fix the Guizhong Ballista, it produces no results, helping the traveller
		and Zhongli conclude that a cocogoat does not exist as it would have been detected by the Guizhong Ballista. After returning to
		Bubu Pharmacy, Zhongli and the traveller tell Qiqi that cocogoat does not exist. This leads Qiqi to remember that she meant to 
		say &quot;coconut milk&quot; instead of &quot;cocogoat.&quot; Baizhu, the head of the pharmacy, arrives and thanks Zhongli and the traveller for 
		taking care of Qiqi while he was gone and gives them a discount on the expensive everlasting incense as a thank you. Childe 
		returns and agrees to pay the remaining amount for the incense while also setting up a supply of coconut milk for the pharmacy.
		</p>
		<p>
		Childe hears from his subordinates about a magical item connected to the sigils he’s been collecting that is hidden by the Liyue
		Qixing at the Golden House, the building where mora is produced. After collecting all the necessary materials for the rite of
		Rex Lapis, Zhongli arranges a meeting with the traveller at a nearby tavern. In the tavern, one of Liyue Qixing’s emissaries, 
		Ganyu, arrives to deliver an extended invitation from Ningguang to the traveller to meet at the Jade Chamber, a floating jade
		building in the sky.
		</p>
		
		<!--Main Content Fight Osial-->
		<h2>A New Star Approaches</h2>
		<p>
		Floating in the sky, the traveller and Paimon try to go to the Jade Chamber, unsure of how to get there. Realizing they are 
		Ningguang’s guests, Keqing introduces herself as one of Ningguang’s emissaries and tells the traveller how to travel upwards
		to the floating Jade Chamber. With a gift in hand, the traveller and Paimon travel up to the Jade Chamber, ready to greet 
		Ningguang, the second-most powerful figure in Liyue after the Geo Archon himself. In the Jade Chamber, Ningguang speaks to
		the traveller about the Fatui Harbingers, namely Childe, who has been researching the Sigils of Permission.
		</p>
		<p>
		Following the meeting with Ningguang, the traveller meets back up with Zhongli to continue preparing for the rite of parting. 
		Zhongli sends the traveller on a quest to find glaze lilies for the rite of parting, where they meet Ganyu once more, only to 
		learn that she is one of the adepti as well. The traveller returns only to find that the adepti and Qixing have confronted 
		each other about Liyue’s safety in the hands of humans, while Ningguang is tracking down the Fatui, who have been collecting 
		the Sigils of Permission. Because of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlour’s connection with the Fatui, Zhongli, the Funeral 
		Parlour’s consultant was brought in for questioning. The traveller reads the situation and looks for Childe, as he is the
		number one suspect behind all that has been going on since he, himself, is a Fatui Harbinger. The traveller finds Childe 
		in the Golden House, looking for the Geo Archon’s gnosis. Seeing that it is not there, he engages to fight the traveller in
		a battle where he unleashes his Foul Legacy Transformation using his delusional, a Fatui-produced object that enhances one's 
		abilities at the cost of their lifespan.
		</p>
		<p>
		After losing the fight, Childe initiates his backup plan and uses the Sigils of Permission to summon Osial, an ancient god whom 
		Rex Lapis had once defeated. Seeing that Liyue was in danger, the Qixing and the adepti set aside their differences to reach a 
		common goal: defend Liyue with their lives. Using the Guizhong Ballista as a long-range weapon, Cloud Retainer, Mountain Shaper,
		and Moon Carver take charge of the aiming. While Keqing leads the Millelith, the traveller is blessed by the other adepti to fight
		the Fatui attacking the Guizhong Ballistas. Osial fires a powerful shot at the platform the traveller was standing on, launching
		them into the sky in the process. Xiao dives in to save the traveller from plunging to their death leaving Ningguang with no 
		other choice but to sacrifice the Jade Chamber by using its extraordinary weight to send Osial back to the bottom of the ocean.

		<p>
		This experience brings the adepti and the human race closer together and makes them more trusting of each other. Meanwhile, 
		Zhongli reveals that he is the Geo Archon and staged his death in order to allow humans to advance with their abilities. He 
		also states that he made a contract to &quot;end all contracts&quot; with another god for a reason unknown to the traveller. Because 
		of the terms of this contract, he hands over his gnosis to Signora, the same Fatui Harbinger who took the gnosis of the Anemo
		Archon, Venti. Concluding the fight with Osial, Keqing helps the traveller put up missing sibling posters as a thank you for
		the traveller helping them. Making close to no progress with finding their missing sibling, the traveller follows Zhongli’s 
		advice to travel to Inazuma, an isolated region ruled by the god of Eternity, the Electro Archon, Baal.
		</p>

		<!--Side Story Shenhe Origins-->
		<h2>The Crane Returns on the Wind</h2>
		<p>
		Before leaving for Inazuma, news of Ninguang’s plans to rebuild the Jade Chamber after Osial’s attack on Liyue reaches the traveller, 
		who decides to take part in a competition to gather the most materials in exchange for Ningguang answering any one question they have. 
		They meet an Adeptus-like human named Shenhe a bit later, who threatens to slam the heads of two people who are harassing her into the 
		ground. Later, they visit the dead Adeptus, the Sea Gazer’s abode, in order to find some sacred books. Upon arriving at the abode, 
		Shenhe dispels the magic surrounding the area as they defeat the monsters inside the domain. They find a piece of vermillionite, a 
		very rare material, inside the domain and present it to Ningguang. A short while later, the traveller and Paimon meet Cloud Retainer,
		who is an Adeptus herself and is said to have trained Shenhe. The next day, the team sets out once again to help with the project. 
		They meet Yunjin, an opera singer who is working on her project called "The Divine Damsel of Devastation." The story was told through
		her father and resembles Shenhe’s origins.
		</p>
		<p>
		The opera mentions that Shenhe came from a village with an evil monster who would demand a child be offered to it. According to 
		Yunjin’s father, the girl (Shenhe) offered to sacrifice herself. However, in reality, her father was the one who sacrificed her 
		in an attempt to bring her dead mother back to life. It’s said that Shenhe was able to fight off the monster for four days before
		Cloud Retainer found her and took her as a disciple.
		</p>
		<p>
		After hearing about the truth of the story, Yunjin comes to Shenhe to apologize. She wants to change the script of the opera to
		include it, but Shenhe states that she prefers the folktale version instead and wants to keep it the way it is. After collecting 
		all the materials, they go to Baiwen and are declared the winners of the competition. Ningguang offers to let Yunjin perform her 
		opera concert at the Jade Chambers. She also answers the traveller’s questions, stating that she does not know where their sibling
		is and instead answering Paimon’s question. Just as the Jade Chamber ascends into the air, a monster appears from the sea. Beisht,
		the wife of Osial, attacks Liyue. Ningguang reveals that she knew about Beisht’s planned attack months prior and chose to build 
		another Jade Chamber in order to prepare for it. She also states that she intends to defend Liyue without the help of the Adepti
		to demonstrate that people are able to defend themselves without their help. During the skirmish, the traveller is knocked down.
		Furious, Shenhe uses her talisman to freeze the sea, momentarily halting Beisht’s movement. This gives the Jade Chamber an
		opportunity to fire back. Beisht is defeated and returns to the sea.

		<h3>About the Sea God</h3>
		<p>
		Genshin has its fair share of references to real-life folktales. One of these is the popular Korean folktale by the name of 
		The Tale of Shim Cheong:
		</p>
		<p>
		Once upon a time, there was a filial daughter of a poor farmer. Having lost his eyesight, he wishes to restore it. One day, 
		he hears a voice telling him to carry 300 sacks of rice to his temple as an offering to Lord Buddha. Not even having three 
		bowls of rice, it seemed like an impossible task for the pair. That night, Shim Cheong dreamed of her mother, who told her 
		to go to the harbour and find a merchant. He will provide her with 300 sacks of rice.
		</p>
		<p>
		It just so happened that the merchant fleet was looking for someone to offer to the Dragon King of the East Sea in order to 
		appease the angry god. She accepted the offer and boarded the ship. The old man, having lost his daughter and his temporary 
		wealth, could only wait for his eyesight to return. After a few days of sailing, they finally reached the area. To the 
		admiration of the sailors, Shim Cheong took a brave leap into the sea. She sank deeper into the ocean until a bright light 
		engulfed her and she could breathe again. She was taken to the Sea god’s castle by his servants, where she dwelled for a 
		bit until she grew weary and homesick. The god granted her permission to see her father again. On the coast of the ocean,
		the fisherman discovered a giant white lotus. They sent it to the sea god. One day, a beautiful woman came out of the lotus.
		Introducing herself once again as Shim Cheong, they decided to get engaged. Shim proposed that they have a giant banquet on 
		land to celebrate their wedding. Though the request was strange, the Sea God agreed regardless. Just at the end of the banquet, 
		an old man approached Shim Cheong. They reunite, and the old farmer gets his vision back.
		</p>

		<!--Liyue Backstory The Gods-->
		<h2>The People of Liyue: Land of Contracts</h2>
		<p>
		More than 6000 years ago, a god by the name of Morax was born. A few years later, the chasm was created when the Solar Chariot 
		(a star) fell out of the sky. An unknown period of time later, Morax raises Mt. Tianheng and defeats many sea monsters in an 
		attempt to cultivate his land for human livability. He eventually meets Guizhong, the god of Dust, and befriends her. They 
		established the Guili Assembly, a trading hub flourishing with trade and mining.
		</p>
		<p>
		Havria, the god of salt, establishes her domain. Known as a gentle god, she strays away from the conflict known as the Archon
		War. During this time, the Oceanid is also present, having arrived in Liyue for an unknown period of time before the war.
		</p>
		
		<!--Liyue Backstory Death of Gods-->
		<h3>The Archon War</h3>
		<p>
		Guizhong dies during the Archon War, although the cause of death is unknown. Ten years after her death, Morax establishes Liyue 
		Harbour and makes a contract with the Adepti to defend the city. The Mililith was also established to protect the walls 
		surrounding the harbour. He also teaches his followers how to create houses, using mora (gold) as a model to demonstrate, 
		and creates minted Mora as the currency to be traded amongst his people. After that, he decides to head off to battle in order
		to maintain the peace between humanity and restore order. Ganyu, an Adeptus, is also born around this time. Eventually, Morax 
		meets a dragon by the name of Azhdaha and restores his eyesight. Havria, the Goddess of salt, perishes when her followers know 
		that she won’t survive the archon war. Morax kills Osial and seals him away underwater.
		</p>
		<p>
		Morax eventually formed a group called the Yakshas, who worked to seal evil spirits. One of these Yakshas is Xiao, also known 
		as the Demon Conqueror or Alatus, who fights to repay Morax for saving him from an ancient god who once enslaved Xiao. Because
		of the built-up karmic debt, many civilians ended up becoming corrupted. Thanks to the efforts of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlour, 
		the effects of the curse were able to be cured after sending the victims off using a butterfly dance ritual. After slaying all
		of the other opposing gods in the Liyue region, Morax becomes the ruler of Liyue. 
		</p>
		
		<!--Liyue Backstory Aftermath-->
		<h3>Post-Archon War</h3>
		<p>
		A girl named Qiqi dies in a skirmish between Adepti and demons. The Adepti revive her using a portion of their power and turn 
		her into a zombie. During this time, Azhdaha slowly begins to go mad as his spirit slowly erodes. Morax seals him inside a mountain.
		Eventually, most of the Yakshas go insane due to the karmic debt collected over time from slaying corrupted souls. After a while,
		all but two of the seven Yakshas kill themselves or die in battle. Just before Bosacious went insane, he went to the Chasm where 
		he never returned. Tragedy strikes once again, as Morax is summoned by the gods of Celestia to participate in the destruction of 
		Khaenri'ah.
