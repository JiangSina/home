		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		Genshin Impact is a free-to-play, open-world action RPG where players can explore the world of Teyvat while making friends 
		along the way.  Players, often referred to as the traveller, set out on a journey across Teyvat to find their long-lost sibling. 
		Whether you swim, climb, or glide through the land, travellers can traverse through Teyvat’s stunning regions to discover new 
		secrets and make new friends using Genshin Impact’s &quot;Co-op Mode.&quot;  Fight battles with friends or alone using beautifully designed 
		characters and their skill sets you obtain through Genshin’s gacha system.  Players alike can master the seven elements connected 
		to their respective regions and fend off monsters with ease.  This website will help players both old and new to uncover the 
		sacred tales behind Teyvat’s beauty.

		<!--Main Content History-->
		<h2>History of Teyvat</h2>
		<p>
		Long ago, there were 7 dragons named the &quot;Primal Sovereign Dragon Lords&quot; who lived to guard the land of Teyvat. They all ruled 
		over their respective elements:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Pyro (Fire)</li>
			<li>Hydro (Water)</li>
			<li>Anemo (Wind)</li>
			<li>Dendro (Nature)</li>
			<li>Electro (Electricity)</li>
			<li>Cryo (Ice)</li>
			<li>Geo (Rock)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		One day, an unknown god, referred to as the &quot;Primordial One,&quot; came and shaped the land of Teyvat. According to the
		<a href = "https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki">Genshin Impact Wiki</a> the god is said to have travelled 
		from another world (unknown, as of today). In some cases, the &quot;Primordial One&quot; is referred to as the God of Eternity or Phanes. 
		It would come to defeat the seven sovereigns in battle, becoming the ruler of the land and making it more inhabitable. The 
		creatures that were originally under the dragon’s rule fled underground, where they established their territory in the Dark Sea,
		a land that will soon be known as Enkanomiya. Soon after, the heavens were created. Along with it was the creation of four angels,
		with Istaroth (the God of Time) being the only known one as of now. Soon, humans would also inhabit the land. 
		</p>
		<p>
		However, this period of benevolence and grace would not last, as another being from a different world came to Teyvat. Waging 
		war on the Primordial one, the evil deity managed to drive the heavenly forces back. During this period of disruption between 
		the heavens and the human world, Enkanomiya sank into the abyss. The people originally living on the land were exposed to vishaps,			which have been living in the abyss for thousands of years. They were not permitted to return. However, the heavenly deities 
		restricted them from doing so. In the end, Phanes was victorious. However, it suffered a change so massive that it decided to 
		erase the civilization that it once built. 
		</p>
		
		<!--Main Content Event-->
		<h2>Archon War</h2>
		<p>
		This period of war conjured by Celestia (the heavens) would be known as the Archon War. Many ancient gods and creatures
		participated in the battle, of which 7 gods referred to as archons would emerge victorious to found the seven nations of Teyvat.
		The reason for this war is not stated, however, it was most likely due to differing ideologies between the gods and creatures. A 
		gnosis was bestowed on each of the 7 archons, which allowed Celestia to control their actions from afar.
		</p>
		<p>
		500 years ago, the nation of Khaenri'ah was destroyed by the seven archons. It can be noted that their actions were controlled by 
		Celestia and not done through their free will. Khaenri'ah was a land ruled by no gods and was located under the seven nations. It’s 
		speculated that the destruction of the godless nation was due to them obtaining forbidden knowledge, that being that the 
		&quot;sky is a lie.&quot; In other words, the stars of Teyvat are fake, and the Primordial One was actually defeated by the Second Being 
		who came to Teyvat. Although it is not known who the being may be, the Genshin Community theorises that the being may be the 
		Heavenly Sustainer, a god who separates the two main characters at the beginning of the game and incites a journey for the 
		protagonist to find their sibling by travelling across the world of Teyvat.

		<h2>The Start of the Traveller's Journey</h2>
		<p>
		At the beginning of the game, the player is introduced to a set of twins, in which they are allowed to pick between the 
		male character (Aether) and the female character (Lumine) to play as. They are descenders otherwise known as people from 
		another world. While travelling through the skies of Teyvat, they come across the Heavenly Sustainer. She captures the other 
		twin (the unchosen twin). After five hundred years, the chosen twin awakens to find their sibling gone. The twin sets out on a 
		journey to find their sibling. While fishing one day, they discover a creature by the name of Paimon, a floating angel-looking 
		being. She wants to act as the traveller’s guide to help them find their lost sibling.
