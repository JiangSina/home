		<!--Introduce Sumeru-->
		<h2>Sumeru: The Nation of Wisdom</h2>
		<p>
		The fourth nation the traveller goes to is Sumeru. Sumeru is the nation representing wisdom, ruled by the Dendro Archon, Buer, 
		who is now referred to as Nahida. This region represents the element of nature and has two main biomes, a desert and a forest. 
		When developing the game, Hoyoverse designed Sumeru based on South Asian countries’ styles and cultures. Sumeru is home to 
		Teyvat’s most knowledgeable scholars and houses the <a href = "https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Akademiya">Sumeru Akademiya</a>.

		<h2>Through Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark</h2>
		<p>
		At the border between Liyue and Sumeru, the traveller and Paimon seek the Dendro Archon for answers regarding their lost sibling. 
		They find a scholar named Haypasia to ask for directions, only to see them ignore their request and head to a cave to light incense.
		This incense causes the traveller to faint and hallucinate a huge, glowing, white tree with a red background sky. A voice whispers
		to them, &quot;...World... Forget me...&quot; to which they wake up to Collei, a forest ranger treating them with medicine. Collei explains
		how her master, Tightnari, found them unconscious under a cave while he was on patrol. Tighnari states that what the traveller saw
		in their dream was a phenomenon affecting all of Teyvat, which they had connected to the consciousness of Irminsul. He then invites
		the traveller to stay with them until they recover fully, to which the traveller complies. Tighnari leaves for another patrol, 
		so Collei stays to accompany the traveller. After explaining to Collei the reason for their travels, Collei explains to the 
		traveller about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and Lesser Lord Kusanali, the two gods who rule the land. She also tells them about
		the Sumeru Akademiya, which requested that the knowledgeable Tighnari be a professor there, which he refused.
		</p>
		<p>
		The following day, Collei lays sick in her bed while Tighnari explains to the traveller how she has a chronic disease called 
		Eleazar, which she has been battling for a long time. Eleazar is a disease unique to Sumeru that causes dark and hardened 
		scales to form on a person’s skin, rendering them immobile after it has completely taken over. Many years ago, Collei’s 
		mother sent her to a Fatui Harbinger by the name of Dottore, hearing that they had a cure. Tighnari explains that while 
		Dottore was able to stabilize her condition, Collei’s experience there left her deathly afraid of physical contact with 
		other people. After the traveller makes a full recovery from their fainting spell, Tighnari advises them to meet with 
		some of his acquaintances in Sumeru City to continue their search for the Dendro Archom, Lesser Lord Kusanali.
		</p>
		<p>
		Upon their arrival in Sumeru City, the travaller and Paimon are each given an Akasha Terminal, a device created by Greater 
		Lord Rukkhadevata through the use of her gnosis that allows for the transfer and sharing of information. Speaking with one
		of Tighnari’s acquaintances, the traveller is disappointed to find out that they have no information on Lesser Lord Kusanali.
		Walking around Sumeru City lamenting, the traveller meets a woman named Dunyarzad, who tells them about a legend of the Archon
		but flees upon seeing two Eremites, mercenaries from Sumeru's desert region, looking for an Eremite named Dehya. The traveller 
		chases after Dunyarzad in hopes of getting more answers until they reach a tavern and meet Dehya, the Eremite bodyguard hired 
		by Dunyarzad’s parents. Dunyarzad, Dehya, the traveller, and Paimon all sit down for a meal hosted by Dunyarzad, where she 
		explains how she’s a follower of Lesser Lord Kusanali because she met Kusanali once when having a fever, leading her to believe
		the Archon, Kusanali, saved her. As a thank you, Dunyarzad helped a dancer named Nilou organize the Sabzeruz Festival, a festival
		once celebrated on Kusanali’s birthday.
		</p>
		<p>
		In preparation for the Sabzeruz Festival, the traveller hears about the Scarlet King, ruler of Sumeru’s Desert region. Peaking
		the traveller’s interest, they offer those speaking about it a large sum of information to disclose more information. Before 
		the money could be handed over, Alhaitham, the Akademiya's Scribe, stopped the traveller from being conned. Alhaitham then 
		explains how he wanted to get back at the Eremites who once conned him, to which the traveller offers to help Alhaitham with
		any troubles as a thank you. Alhaitham tells them how he was looking for a knowledge capsule, a mini akasha that can connect 
		to the akasha terminals to help the user gain more knowledge. However, the possession or selling of these capsules are illegal. 
		Alhaitham redirects the traveller to meet with Dori, a merchant who trades many high-quality goods for large sums of money, as 
		Alhaitham is blacklisted from purchasing items from Dori. Upon purchasing Dori’s knowledge capsule, she reveals that another 
		person has purchased one of the capsules and warns them to watch out for them in case they steal the traveller's capsule.
		</p>
		<p>
		The traveller fetches the knowledge capsule as requested by Alhaitham and meets up with him near the docks of the city. They 
		see the other buyer of the knowledge capsule sold by Dori on the docks. The buyer, having taken the canned knowledge from his 
		capsule, appears to be in a dazed state. Before the Matra, Sumeru’s military force comes to arrest the buyer for illegally 
		possessing a knowledge capsule, Alhaitham secretly snatches the used capsule from the buyer, who mutters &quot;World... forget me,&quot; 
		the same words the traveller heard from Irminsul when they fainted. Alhaitham returns to the Akademiya, while the traveller and
		Paimon return to the Sabzeruz Festival.

		<h2>The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings</h2>
		<p>
		The traveller meets up with Dunyarzad and Dehya to enjoy the Sabzeruz Festival. They went to the different stalls and played 
		games together, enjoying the festival. At the end of the day, Dunyarzad reveals to the traveller that she’s been suffering 
		from the chronic disease, Eleazar, for many years and explains how her parents hired Deyha as a bodyguard for this reason. 
		She thanks the traveller for making happy memories with her and Dehya while they still can. The traveller goes to bed that 
		night feeling sad but determined to bring Dunyarzad more happy memories the next day. When they wake up the next day, the 
		traveller and Paimon are the only ones who feel off. As if they were reliving the previous day, they realized they were 
		stuck in a time loop. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Another day passes with the same events occurring, while the health of Dunyarzad seems to be worsening. This time, the 
		traveller spots a strange girl out of the corner of their eye and decides to chase after her. The traveller catches up 
		to the girl, and she introduces herself as Nahida. Nahida hands the traveller a knowledge capsule, which reveals to the
		traveller that they’ve been stuck in a one-day samsara for several days now. Another day passes, but the traveller 
		immediately goes to Nahida to figure out how to break out of the time loop. This time, Nahida reveals to the traveller 
		that she is Lesser Lord Kusanali, the Dendro Archon, and then explains to them how they need to get more people to know 
		what’s going on in order to exit the time loop in a day. The next day, the traveller brings Dehya with them to Nahida.
		Nahida explains to the both of them that the sages, the leaders of the Akademiya, are responsible for the time loop and
		are using the akasha terminals to do so. In response to this, the traveller concludes that they must take off their 
		akasha terminals to remove the mental fatigue they’ve been exhibiting.
		</p>
		<p>
		The traveller leaves the city, assuming that the time loop only applies to those in the city for whom their hypothesis 
		proves correct. This makes the traveller realize that the sages are using the akasha terminals to steal the dreams of 
		the people of Sumeru to power the time loop. Knowing this, Nahida concludes that by making the host of the time loop 
		realize they are dreaming, they will be able to discontinue the time loop. She then sadly informs the traveller and 
		Dehya that Dunyarzad's consciousness disappeared since it could no longer handle the dream harvesting of the akasha 
		terminals. The traveller traces back their steps to go through all the events of the day to find out who the host of 
		the dream is. They then decide to go to the one event they had yet to visit, the Dance of Sabzeruz. Watching Nilou 
		passionately dance the Dance of Sabzeruz, the traveller recognizes her as the host of the dream. The traveller 
		proceeds to confront Nilou about her dream, to which she decides to dance to force her dreamscape to dissolve into 
		reality. This reawakens Dunyarzad’s consciousness, so the traveller and Paimon rush back to Nahida and Dehya to tell 
		them the good news.

		</div>
		
		<p>
		Celebrating their victory, Nahida tells the traveller how she was able to sustain the last bit of Dunyarzad’s consciousness 
		before it completely blew out. She tells them how the sages won’t be able to host another event of this size again in the
		near future because breaking the time loop broke the akasha’s ability to harvest dreams unless it's fixed. Nahida parted
		ways with the traveller for the day to rest.

		<h2>Dreams, Emptiness, Deception</h2>
		<p>
		The traveller meets with Nahida again, but this time she possesses the mechanical body of Katheryne, a robot working for 
		the Adventurers Guild. She asks the traveller about Dunyarzad’s health and states that in order to fully rid her of Eleazar, 
		they need to fix Irminsul's withering. To do this, they needed someone from the Akademiya who has connections to Irminsul 
		and has access to the documents on it. They decide to convince Setaria, the Grand Sage of the Akademiya’s subordinate, 
		that the Scarlet King's resurrection is a lie made by the Akademiya. She reveals that an expelled student of the Akademiya
		was returning to the city, causing the sages to worry, and advises them to collect the documents at night when the security
		loosens. Nahida, still in Katheryne’s mechanical body, and the traveller unexpectedly find many people in a trance at the
		entrance of the Akademiya. Suddenly, a man appears from the crowd, introducing himself as Dottore, one of the eleven Fatui 
		Harbingers. He admits that he tinkered with the people’s akasha terminals, making them believe the traveller was a hero and
		causing their awe. Nahida uses her ability to put the people to sleep before escaping the situation.

		</div>
		
		<p>
		The traveller decides to go to Tighnari for help. Back in the forest, Collei reveals that Tighnari had left for a secluded 
		part of the forest for reasons unknown. Making it to the secluded part of the forest, the traveller meets up with Nahida 
		once again, who narrowly escaped Dottore by mind-jumping. In a nearby greenhouse, the traveller runs into Haypasia, the 
		scholar they met when they first arrived in Sumeru. She offers to show the traveller a vision she saw while burning incense.
		This vision, however, was that of the past of Scaramouche, the Fatui Harbinger in charge of creating delusions back in Inazuma.

		</div>
		
		<p>
		This caused Haypasia to go mad and run off. Suddenly, the Corps of Thirty, a mercenary group hired by the Akademiya, 
		arrived to attack and stabbed Katheryne’s mechanical body, which Nahida was possessing. Almost instantly, Nahida switches
		bodies with the traveller for a brief moment to escape. The traveller wakes up in Nahida’s body, locked in the Sanctuary
		of Surasthana, where they bear witness to Scaramouche in the process of being artificially made into a god. The traveller
		wakes up in their own body again, fleeing the greenhouse with Tighnari. Paimon explains that after allowing the traveller
		to switch back to their own body, Nahida was captured by Dottore and locked in the sanctuary with no means of possessing
		bodies anymore. Following Nahida’s advice, the traveller goes to the desert part of Sumeru for more help, while Tighnari
		stays behind to help Haypasia.

		<p>
		Making it to the desert, the traveller and Paimon find Alhaitham waiting for their arrival. He offers to help, and they 
		join forces. Making it to the village in the desert, Cyno, General Mahamatra (general of the Matra military force in Sumeru), 
		attacks Alhaitham, wanting to know the location of the knowledge capsule he illegally possesses. Dehya arrives at the scene 
		to mediate the fight between Cyno and Alhaitham, but a sandstorm appears, so they all head into the hut of the village chief,
		Candace. Inside the hut, the group discusses their reasons for being in the desert since it isn’t a desirable place to be. 
		The topic of the Village Keepers gets brought into conversation. Cyno explains how the Village Keepers were previously Akademiya
		scholars who went mad after using forbidden knowledge capsules. They were shunned from society and brought to the village, 
		where they remained outcasts. But one day, when an earthquake struck, one of the mad scholars used their abilities to protect
		the village from any damage. This brought acceptance to all the mad scholars, now called Village Keepers for their courageous acts.
		Just then, a young boy named Isak appeared, asking for help to find his grandpa, one of the Village Keepers.
		</p>
		
		<!--Main Content The Truth Beind the Hatred-->
		<h2>King Deshret and the Three Magi</h2>
		<p>
		While looking for Isak’s grandpa, he overhears some desert folk speaking about the Scarlet King’s resurrection and their hatred 
		for the Dendro Archon, and how she was responsible for the deaths of the desert folk. A fellow Village Keeper points out leads 
		about Isak’s grandpa that might be in the abandoned Eleazar hospital nearby and suggests they go investigate. At the hospital, 
		Alhaitham hears a voice crying out for help. This voice belongs to Razak, Alhaitham’s senior. They take him back to the village, 
		where Cyno speaks up about how he noticed their every move being countered by the Akademiya. To this, Alhaitham says the Akademiya
		saw Cyno as a threat, so they had the akasha terminals monitor and predict his every move. Dehya, on the other hand, goes to 
		another group of Emerites led by Rahman, asking for help. Trusting a fellow Emerite, Rahman and his group agree to help.
		</p>
		<p>
		The group meets up with the Emerites and Rahman the next day. They found Isak’s grandpa, thinking he was an enemy and captured
		him. When an earthquake suddenly occurs, Isak’s grandpa uses his abilities to protect everyone from danger until the sand 
		around them swallows them whole. Falling lower into the ground, the earthquake calms, leaving them in some mysterious ruins 
		owned by the Scarlet King. Inside the ruins, they find the Dendro Archon’s power imbued within, signifying a harmony between
		the Scarlet King and the Dendro Archon that counters what the desert folk have always believed. Alhaitham discovers and 
		deciphers a transcript explaining how the Scarlet King introduced forbidden knowledge to the people of the desert, which
		he ruled over, causing the people to go mad. To save the people, the Scarlet King sacrifices himself while Greater 
		Lord Rukkhadevata, the Dendro Archon at the time, reverts to a small child, giving her life force away. Knowing this, 
		the traveller reveals to the group that the Fatui and the sages are replacing their current god, Nahida, with Scaramouche
		by artificial means. They begin to concoct a plan to stop the sages and rescue their god, Nahida.

		<h2>Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises</h2>
		<p>
		The group discusses a plan where they can all get involved to infiltrate the Akademiya, where the sages are. With his 
		status as General Mahamatra, Cyno will work with the guards at the outpost to arrest Rahman and his men, as it is the 
		safest option to infiltrate Sumeru City. Convincing Tighnari for help, his close ties with the Akademiya allow him to 
		get as much information on Dottore as they need. Having previously spoken to Dottore himself, Tighnari tells them where
		Dottore was leaving from: the harbour. Seeing Dottore’s smug attitude at the port, they realize that Dottore had 
		planned for this and return to Tighnari, fearing the worst. Dehya and the traveller find Tighnari being ambushed 
		by the Fatui. While Dehya is fighting them off, the traveller hears Scaramouche’s voice in their head. Scaramouche 
		talks about his loathing for humans as he is a discarded puppet just like the Raiden Shogun puppet, both being made
		by the Electro Archon, Ei. He then summons bolts of lightning, one of which strikes Tighnari. Dehya had taken care
		of all the Fatui, so she and the traveller brought the injured Tighnari into the nearby greenhouse to rest.
		</p>
		<p>
		The next day, Alhaithtam gives the traveller a rundown of the plan. He explains how they will be infiltrating the 
		Grand Sage, Azar’s office, to gain access to his console, which will tell them a way they can free Nahida from the 
		sanctuary she is trapped in. The traveller and Alhaitham waltz through the front door of the Akademiya, using 
		Alhaitham’s status as a scribe to go unquestioned. Inside the Akademiya, Azar immediately notices them and brings
		them to his office, where Alhaitham gives Azar information about the traveller, causing the traveller to believe 
		they were betrayed. Unexpectedly, Azar calls Alhaitham a liar, resulting in Alhaitham plunging towards Azar, 
		dropping the knowledge capsule in the process. Alhaitham knocks something over onto the console before the 
		guards apprehend him to be exiled to the village in the desert while the traveller is taken to the confinement room.

		<p>
		In the confinement room, the traveller is able to connect to Nahida’s consciousness and break the barrier surrounding
		her, awakening her consciousness in the process. Outside, Nilou had agreed to the plan and was ready to set it in 
		motion. She goes to perform a dance at the Akademiya entrance. Seeing how any form of the arts is forbidden in the 
		Akademiya, Azar orders for Nilou to be detained, but the order uploaded to the guards was changed to apprehending 
		an escaped Nahida due to the item Alhaitham knocked onto the console. With no guards present at the Akademiya, 
		Dehya and the Emerites go into action while Isak, the little boy, dresses up as Nahida to lure the guards to where 
		Dehya and the Emerites will defeat them. Afterwards, Deyha frees the traveller from the confinement room, resulting 
		in a successful mission.

		<p>
		The traveller heads to the sanctuary, where they meet Nahida. She then proceeds to revoke the sages’ access to the akasha 
		terminal and prepares for a fight with Scaramouche, the false god. They go to the location of the facility containing the
		false god, where Nahida asks the traveller to fight as she is still weak and is only able to connect to Scaramouche’s 
		conscience to retrieve the gnosis powering his god form. In the facility, Nahida and the traveller find Scaramouche in
		a giant mechanical suit, where he challenges them to a battle of the gods. Despite the many attempts, Scaramouche 
		reaches to grab Nahida’s gnosis from her chest, only to have her reveal that he’d been living in a repeating samsara,
		so they were able to learn all his track patterns and easily defeat him. Now, Nahida reaches out to grab the electro 
		gnosis that had been powering Scaramouche’s god form. Begging her not to take it from him, he plunges to the ground 
		from a great height, putting him into a coma.

		<p>
		With the help of the electro gnosis and her own, Nahida and the traveller enter the last memory of Nahida’s predecessor, 
		Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. Inside the memory the traveller recognizes as Irminsul, they meet what looks like an exact 
		replica of Nahida, believing it to be the Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's consciousness. Rukkhadevata tells Nahida that
		to save Irminsul, they have to erase Rukkhadevata from it, which will also remove all traces of her existence from 
		Teyvat. As Rukkhadevata removes herself from existence, forbidden knowledge and the Eleazar disease are removed 
		with her, while Irminsul is restored along with the people of Sumeru’s ability to dream freely.

		</div>
		
		<p>
		Exiting the memory, Nahida and Paimon had seemingly forgotten all that had happened, while the traveller maintained 
		all their memories. Back in the sanctuary, Dottore walks in, using a special sound wave to put the traveller and 
		Paimon to sleep so that he could speak to Nahida alone. Wishing to negotiate with Nahida, he proposes to erase 
		the multiple clones he created of himself to decrease the damage he can do in return for the electro gnosis to 
		which Nahida agrees. He also offers to give Nahida information about the sky being fake in return for her gnosis,
		which she once again complies with.
		</p>
		<p>
		Following these events, a feast was organized by the team that saved Nahida. After resolving past disagreements, 
		Nahida is finally at peace with herself. Speaking to the traveller alone, she reveals that after digging through 
		the akasha terminals, she found out that the traveller’s sibling appeared in Khaenri'ah after a great cataclysm 
		and that the Fatui has classified them as the Fourth Decsender. She then promises the traveller to help them in 
		their journey of finding their lost sibling and recommends they travel to Fontaine to meet with the Hydro Archon, Focalors.
